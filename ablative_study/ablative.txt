This folder contains the different code where we performed ablation for better understanding of the project
For this experiment, we decided to tweak the results we got from training our dataset 3 with Resnet18
The default hyperprameters are:
LR=0.001
Optimizer=Adam
Batch Size=32
These hyperparameters achieved a test accuarcy of 25.2%
For the scope of this experiment, one hyperparameter is changed while the others are kept constant to monitor how a specific hyperparameter affects the whole performance of the model.
