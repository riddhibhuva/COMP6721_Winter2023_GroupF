# Birds Image Classification

This project focuses on the classification of birds using deep learning techniques. We have used three different datasets for training and validation of our models.

# Methodology

We have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for building our classification models. Specifically, we have used models such as ResNet-18, VGG-16, and MobileNet, and compared their performance.

# Results

We have achieved an accuracy of [%] on the test set using the ResNet-18 model. We have also compared the performance of other pre-trained models and reported their accuracies.
