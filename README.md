# Birds Image Classification

This project focuses on the classification of birds using deep learning techniques. We have used three different datasets for training and validation of our models.

# Methodology

We have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for building our classification models. Specifically, we have used models such as ResNet-18, VGG-16, and MobileNet, and compared their performance.

# Results

We have achieved an accuracy of [%] on the test set using the ResNet-18 model. We have also compared the performance of other pre-trained models and reported their accuracies.

# Files

# Getting Started

To run this project using Anaconda Navigator or Jupyter Notebook, you will first need to create a new environment with Python 3 installed and activate it. Then, clone the repository and install the required packages within the environment. Finally, you can click on "Run all" within the environment using Jupyter interface in the terminal or a run each code cell in Jupyter Notebook one by one.


# Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the dataset authors for making the dataset available to the public.
